        Find a quadratic residue (mod p) of 'a'. p
        must be an odd prime.

        Solve the congruence of the form:
            x^2 = a (mod p)
        And returns x. Note that p - x is also a root.

        0 is returned is no square root exists for
        these a and p.

        for some simple cases in which the solution
        is known from an identity). This algorithm
        runs in polynomial time (unless the
